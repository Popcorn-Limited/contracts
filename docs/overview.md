# Overview
To faciliate the fast changing needs of DeFi we create a vault that can grow with us into any direction we require. The goal is to create a vault that has absolute flexibility of what protocols to interact with and how but still remains easy to manage and save us on developing new strategies for each protocol out there.

For users the vault abstracts away the complexity of interacting with multiple protocols and allows them to deposit and withdraw with a single interface. They wont need to chase new protocols or rebalance as all this complexity is abstracted away.

## User Benefits
**Simplified Onboarding:** Instantly access the leading DeFi integrations available within an ecosystem.

**Higher Yields:** Veda provides simplified access to complex DeFi strategies, coupled with ongoing monitoring to optimize performance.

**Lower Gas Costs:** Transactions are batched for efficiency, and users don't pay gas costs for on-going rebalances.

## Protocol Benefits
**Simplified Ecosystem Onboarding:** By eliminating the need for users to navigate various integrations and continuously monitor optimal strategies, Veda enhances user convenience and engagement. 

**Higher Base Yields:** Veda's complex DeFi strategies and optimization can result in higher base yields which can be more appealing to users. This can result in more efficient user acquisition, higher retention rates, and lower incentive expenditure.

**Liquidity Optimization:** Veda allocates liquidity to inefficiencies within a given ecosystem, thereby fostering liquidity provision and addressing market gaps.

**Capital Flexibility:** By building a robust capital base, Veda enables swift deployment of funds towards a protocol's strategic priorities. For instance, a designated portion of liquidity can instantly seed new integrations, facilitating ecosystem expansion.

**Flexible Off-Chain Algorithms:** Veda enables flexible AI-powered algorithms to securely optimize on-chain liquidity. Imposing minimal constraints on the off-chain system is necessary for yield solutions to keep pace with the evolving DeFi landscape. 

**Natively Cross-Chain:** Thanks to Gnosis Safes all vaults can access any EVM-compatible chain from the same interface.

**Composability:** VaultCraft vaults are strictly ERC-7540 compliant. Each vault share can be easily integrated into any DeFi protocol or application.


## Manager Benefits
**Simplicity:** By using Gnosis Safes you can manage a vault in a familiar environment with all the quality of live improvements you come to expect. No need to learn new interfaces or tools.

**Security:** VaultCraft vaults are Gnosis Safes, the most battle-tested and secure smart contract wallets.

**Flexibility:** VaultCraft vaults are fully customizable. You can interact with any DeFi protocol, use any strategy, and set any parameters. Just like using simply an EOA.
